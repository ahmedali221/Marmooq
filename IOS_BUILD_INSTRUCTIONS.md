## üöÄ **HOW TO REBUILD THE iOS APP:**

### Step 1: Clean the iOS build
```bash
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
flutter clean
cd ..
```

### Step 2: Get dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Install iOS pods
```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

### Step 4: Build for iPhone
```bash
# For connected iPhone device:
flutter build ios --release

# Or to run directly on connected iPhone:
flutter run --release
```

### Step 5: Open in Xcode (if you need to build .ipa for TestFlight/App Store)
```bash
cd ios
open Runner.xcworkspace
```

In Xcode:
1. Select your device or "Any iOS Device"
2. Go to Product ‚Üí Archive
3. Once archive completes, click "Distribute App"

## üîç **Testing Checklist:**

After rebuilding, test these scenarios on iPhone:

- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Add products to cart
- [ ] Proceed to checkout
- [ ] Phone number gets filled (check logs)
- [ ] Checkout page loads without errors
- [ ] If Shopify error appears ‚Üí page auto-refreshes
- [ ] Complete order successfully

---

## üì± **Debugging on iPhone:**

To see logs from iPhone:

1. Connect iPhone via USB
2. Run: `flutter run --release` or `flutter run --debug`
3. Watch the console for:
   - `Platform: ios`
   - `Phone formatted: +965...`
   - `DETECTED: Shopify server error` (if error occurs)
   - `Auto-refreshing page due to Shopify server error...`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### Issue 1: "There was a problem with our checkout"
**Solution:** The app now auto-refreshes after 3 seconds. This is a Shopify server issue, not an app issue.

### Issue 2: WebView not loading
**Solution:** Check that `offeraatkw.com` is in Info.plist (already done)

### Issue 3: Phone field not filled
**Solution:** Check logs for "Phone formatted:" - if null, demo number `+96555544789` is used

### Issue 4: Build fails
**Solution:**
```bash
flutter clean
rm -rf ios/Pods ios/Podfile.lock
flutter pub get
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
flutter build ios
```

## üìã **Files Modified:**

1. `ios/Runner/Info.plist` - Added offeraatkw.com domain exception
2. `lib/features/shipment/view/checkout_webview_screen.dart` - Auto-refresh, iOS user agent, better logging
3. `lib/features/shipment/view/shipmentPage.dart` - Phone null handling
4. `lib/features/shipment/services/checkout_service.dart` - Phone validation & fallback

---

## üéØ **Expected Behavior:**

### On Android (working):
‚úÖ Checkout loads ‚Üí Phone filled ‚Üí Order completes

### On iPhone (should now work):
‚úÖ Checkout loads ‚Üí Phone filled ‚Üí If server error ‚Üí Auto-refresh ‚Üí Order completes

## üí° **Key Differences Between Android & iPhone:**

| Feature | Android | iPhone |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Network Security | AndroidManifest.xml | Info.plist |
| WebView Engine | Chrome | Safari (WKWebView) |
| User Agent | Chrome Mobile | Safari Mobile |
| Error Handling | More permissive | Stricter (needs exceptions) |

---

## üÜò **If Still Not Working on iPhone:**

1. Check iOS console logs for specific errors
2. Verify Info.plist has all three domains:
   - localhost
   - myshopify.com
   - shopify.com
   - **offeraatkw.com** ‚Üê NEW
3. Try on iPhone Safari browser first (not app) to verify Shopify store works
4. Check Shopify admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Checkout for any region restrictions

---

**REBUILD NOW WITH:**
```bash
flutter clean && flutter pub get && cd ios && pod install && cd .. && flutter run --release
```
