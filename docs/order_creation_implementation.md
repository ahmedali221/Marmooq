**ShopifyStore Instance:**
- Product catalog access
- Inventory management
- Store configuration retrieval

**ShopifyCart Instance:**
- Cart creation and management
- Line item manipulation
- Checkout process initiation

#### 2. Order-Related APIs

**Cart Management:**
- `createCart()`: Initialize new shopping carts
